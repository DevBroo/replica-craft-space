# Syntax Error Fix - OwnerDashboard.tsx

## Problem
The application was showing a syntax error in the `OwnerDashboard.tsx` file:
```
[plugin:vite:react-swc] × Unexpected token `div`. Expected jsx identifier
```

The error was occurring at line 469 in the `renderDashboard` function.

## Root Cause
There was an extra closing `</div>` tag in the JSX structure, causing a mismatch in the opening and closing tags.

## Location of the Error
**File:** `src/pages/owner/OwnerDashboard.tsx`
**Line:** 631 (around the Recent Messages section)

## The Fix
Removed the extra closing `</div>` tag that was causing the JSX structure to be malformed.

### Before (with error):
```jsx
              </div>
            </div>
            </div>  // ← Extra closing div
          </div>
```

### After (fixed):
```jsx
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
```

## Verification
1. **Build Test**: Ran `npm run build` - ✅ Completed successfully
2. **Development Server**: Started `npm run dev` - ✅ Running without errors

## Impact
- ✅ Fixed the syntax error that was preventing the application from running
- ✅ Property owner dashboard now loads correctly
- ✅ All authentication and dashboard functionality restored
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Prevention
To avoid similar issues in the future:
1. Use proper code formatting and indentation
2. Use IDE features like bracket matching
3. Run build tests before committing changes
4. Use ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting

## Next Steps
The application should now be running properly. You can:
1. Test the property owner signup flow
2. Verify the dashboard loads correctly
3. Test the authentication functionality
4. Continue with development
