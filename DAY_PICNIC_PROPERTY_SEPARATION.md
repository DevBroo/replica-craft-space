# Day Picnic and Property Separation Implementation

## 🎯 **Overview**

Successfully implemented a complete separation between **Day Picnic** and **Property** creation forms, with unified image storage and distinct workflows for each type of listing.

---

## 📋 **What Was Changed**

### **1. Created Dedicated Day Picnic Wizard** 
**File:** `/src/components/owner/DayPicnicWizard.tsx`

- **8-step wizard** specifically designed for day picnic experiences
- **Custom form fields** relevant to day picnics:
  - Capacity management (total guests, min/max)
  - Duration categories (half-day, full-day, extended)
  - Meal plan options
  - Day picnic specific amenities
  - Timing (start/end times)
  - Inclusions/exclusions
- **Integrated image upload** using the same storage as properties
- **Automatic property creation** with `property_type: 'Day Picnic'`
- **Day picnic package creation** in `day_picnic_packages` table

### **2. Updated Property Management Interface**
**File:** `/src/components/owner/PropertiesNew.tsx`

- **Added separate "Add Day Picnic" button** alongside "Add Property"
- **Visual distinction**: Orange outline button for day picnics
- **Separate modal handling** for day picnic wizard
- **Maintained existing property wizard** for regular properties

### **3. Updated Property Wizard Categories**
**File:** `/src/components/owner/wizard/BasicDetails.tsx`

- **Removed "Day Picnic"** from regular property type options
- **Maintained consistency** with search service categories
- **Prevents confusion** by forcing day picnic creation through dedicated wizard

### **4. Unified Image Storage System**
**File:** `/unified-image-storage-policies.sql`

- **Single storage bucket** (`public-images`) for all images
- **Organized folder structure**:
  - `properties/` - Property and day picnic images
  - `covers/` - Location cover images
  - `avatars/` - User avatar images
- **Comprehensive RLS policies** for secure access
- **Public read access** for website display
- **Authenticated upload permissions** with folder restrictions

### **5. Enhanced Image Upload in Day Picnic Wizard**

- **Direct Supabase storage integration** using `public-images` bucket
- **Progress tracking** during multi-image uploads
- **Image preview and management** with remove functionality
- **Primary image designation** for the first uploaded image
- **Error handling** with user-friendly toast notifications

## 🔄 **How It Works Now**

### **For Property Owners:**

#### **Creating Regular Properties:**
1. Click **"Add Property"** button
2. Opens **PropertyWizard** with 8 steps
3. Choose from property types: Hotels, Villas, Resorts, etc. (Day Picnic excluded)
4. Complete full property setup with rooms, amenities, pricing
5. Images uploaded to `public-images/properties/` folder

#### **Creating Day Picnic Experiences:**
1. Click **"Add Day Picnic"** button (orange outline)
2. Opens **DayPicnicWizard** with 8 specialized steps
3. Set capacity, duration, meal plans, and day-specific amenities
4. Upload images to the same `public-images/properties/` folder
5. Automatically creates both property record and day picnic package

### **For System:**

#### **Database Structure:**
- **Properties table**: Contains both regular properties and day picnics
- **Day Picnic Properties**: Have `property_type = 'Day Picnic'`
- **Day Picnic Packages table**: Contains day-picnic specific data (meal plans, duration, inclusions)
- **Unified image storage**: All images in `public-images` bucket with organized folders

#### **Search & Display:**
- **Search service**: Recognizes "day-picnic" as separate category
- **Property filtering**: Day picnics show in separate tab in owner dashboard
- **Public display**: Day picnics appear in dedicated sections on website

## 🛡️ **Security & Storage**

### **Image Upload Security:**
- **Authenticated users only** can upload images
- **Folder-based permissions** prevent unauthorized access
- **File type restrictions** (JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF only)
- **Size limits** (50MB per file)
- **Owner-based access control** for updates/deletions

### **Database Security:**
- **RLS policies** ensure users only access their own properties
- **Admin override** for management purposes
- **Proper foreign key relationships** between properties and packages
