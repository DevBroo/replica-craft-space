# Property Owner Signup Fix

## Problem
The property owner signup functionality was not working properly. Users couldn't access a dedicated property owner signup page.

## Root Cause
1. No dedicated `/owner/signup` route in the App.tsx routing configuration
2. The Signup component wasn't handling the `/owner/signup` path to automatically set the role
3. Missing phone field in the RegisterData interface
4. Inconsistent redirect logic for different user types

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Property Owner Signup Route
**File:** `src/App.tsx`
- Added `/owner/signup` route that uses the existing Signup component
- Route: `<Route path="/owner/signup" element={<Signup />} />`

### 2. Enhanced Signup Component Role Detection
**File:** `src/pages/Signup.tsx`
- Updated the useEffect to detect `/owner/signup` path and automatically set role to 'owner'
- Added path-specific UI text for property owners:
  - Page title: "Create Property Owner Account" (when on /owner/signup)
  - Description: "Join Picnify as a property owner and start listing your properties"
  - Card title: "Property Owner Sign Up"
  - Success message: "Start listing your properties!"
- Updated redirect logic to send property owners to `/owner/login` after signup

### 3. Fixed RegisterData Interface
**File:** `src/lib/auth.ts`
- Added `phone: string` field to RegisterData interface
- Updated register function to include phone in user data

### 4. Created Test File
**File:** `test-owner-signup.html`
- Comprehensive test page with multiple test scenarios
- Test links for different signup flows
- Expected results and debugging information

## How It Works Now

### Property Owner Signup Flow
1. **Access:** Users can now access property owner signup via:
   - `/owner/signup` (dedicated route)
   - `/signup?role=owner` (general signup with role parameter)

2. **Role Pre-selection:** 
   - `/owner/signup` automatically sets role to "Property Owner"
   - `/signup?role=owner` also sets role via URL parameter

3. **UI Customization:**
   - Page title and description are specific to property owners
   - Form validation remains the same for all user types
   - Success message is tailored for property owners

4. **Post-Signup Flow:**
   - Success message shows for 3 seconds
   - Redirects to `/owner/login` (property owner login page)
   - Email verification required before login

### Available Routes
- `/signup` - General signup with role selector
- `/signup?role=customer` - Customer signup (pre-selects customer)
- `/signup?role=owner` - Property owner signup (pre-selects owner)
- `/signup?role=agent` - Agent signup (pre-selects agent)
- `/owner/signup` - Dedicated property owner signup (auto-sets owner role)

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. **Dedicated Owner Signup:** `/owner/signup`
   - ✅ Role automatically set to "Property Owner"
   - ✅ UI shows property owner specific text
   - ✅ Redirects to `/owner/login` after signup

2. **General Signup with Owner Role:** `/signup?role=owner`
   - ✅ Role pre-selected as "Property Owner"
   - ✅ Same functionality as dedicated route

3. **Form Validation:**
   - ✅ All required fields validated
   - ✅ Email format validation
   - ✅ Password strength requirements
   - ✅ Terms agreement required

### Test Data
```
First Name: John
Last Name: Smith
Email: john.smith.owner@example.com
Phone: +1 555 123 4567
Password: OwnerPass123!
Confirm Password: OwnerPass123!
Role: Property Owner (pre-selected)
Terms: ✅ Accept Terms of Service
```

## Files Modified
1. `src/App.tsx` - Added owner signup route
2. `src/pages/Signup.tsx` - Enhanced role detection and UI customization
3. `src/lib/auth.ts` - Fixed RegisterData interface and registration logic
4. `test-owner-signup.html` - Created comprehensive test file

## Next Steps
1. Test the property owner signup functionality using the test file
2. Verify email verification works correctly
3. Test the complete user journey from signup to dashboard access
4. Consider adding additional property owner specific fields if needed

## Notes
- The existing general signup functionality remains unchanged
- All user types (customer, owner, agent) can still use the general `/signup` route
- The property owner dashboard (`/owner`) already exists and handles the login flow
- Email verification is required before users can access their dashboards
