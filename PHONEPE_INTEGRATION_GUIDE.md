## PhonePe Service Features

### Payment Creation
```typescript

  bookingId: 'booking-123',
  propertyId: 'property-456',
  userId: 'user-789',
  amount: 5000, // INR amount
  currency: 'INR',
  description: 'Hotel booking',
  customerEmail: 'customer@example.com',
  customerPhone: '9876543210'
});
```

### Payment Status Check
```typescript
const status = await PhonePeService.checkPaymentStatus('TXN_123456');
```

### Refund Processing
```typescript
const refund = await PhonePeService.initiateRefund(
  'original-txn-id',
  1000, // refund amount
  'Customer cancellation'
);
```

## Database Integration

### Tables Used:
- `payments` - Stores payment transactions
- `bookings` - Updated with payment status
- `app_settings` - PhonePe configuration storage

### Payment Flow:
1. Create booking with 'pending' status
2. Generate PhonePe payment URL
3. User completes payment on PhonePe
4. Callback updates payment status
5. Booking status updated to 'confirmed'

## Testing

### Test Cards (PhonePe Sandbox):
- Use any valid test card numbers provided by PhonePe
- Test UPI IDs: test@paytm, test@phonepe
- All payments in sandbox are simulated

### Test Scenarios:
1. **Successful Payment**: Complete payment flow
2. **Failed Payment**: Test error handling
3. **Pending Payment**: Test status checking
4. **Refund**: Test refund processing

## Security Features

### Data Protection:
- Client secrets stored securely in environment variables
- Payment data encrypted in transit
- No sensitive card data stored locally
- PCI DSS compliant integration

### RLS Policies:
- Users can only see their own payments
- Property owners can see bookings for their properties
- Admins have full access for management

## Production Deployment

### Steps to Go Live:
1. Update environment variables:
   ```
   VITE_PHONEPE_ENVIRONMENT=production
   VITE_PHONEPE_CLIENT_ID=your-live-client-id
   VITE_PHONEPE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-live-client-secret
   ```
2. Update PhonePe service base URL to production endpoint
3. Test thoroughly in production environment
4. Monitor payment callbacks and status updates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Payment URL not generated**: Check API credentials
2. **Callback not received**: Verify callback URL accessibility
