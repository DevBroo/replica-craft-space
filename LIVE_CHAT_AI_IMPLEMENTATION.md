# 🤖 AI-Powered Live Chat Implementation

## Overview
I've successfully implemented a comprehensive AI-powered live chat system for Picnify that automatically collects customer details and integrates with an admin dashboard for monitoring and management.

## 🚀 Key Features Implemented

### 1. AI Chat Service (`src/lib/aiChatService.ts`)
- **Smart Information Extraction**: Automatically extracts customer details from natural conversation
  - Name detection from various patterns ("My name is...", "I'm...", etc.)
  - Email address extraction using regex patterns
  - Phone number detection (Indian format support)
  - Booking reference identification
  - Issue type classification (booking, payment, property, account)
  - Urgency level assessment (high, medium, low)

- **Contextual AI Responses**: Generates intelligent responses based on:
  - Conversation history
  - Collected customer information
  - Issue type and urgency
  - Confidence scoring

- **Automatic Escalation**: Smart escalation to human agents when:
  - High urgency issues detected
  - Conversation becomes too complex (>10 messages)
  - Complex booking issues persist
  - AI confidence is low

### 2. Enhanced Live Chat Hook (`src/hooks/useLiveChat.ts`)
- **AI Integration**: Seamlessly processes messages through AI service
- **Real-time Updates**: Updates customer details in real-time as conversation progresses
- **Mode Switching**: Automatically switches from AI to human agent when needed
- **State Management**: Maintains conversation state and customer details
- **Database Integration**: Saves all interactions and customer details to Supabase

### 3. Improved Live Chat Modal (`src/components/support/LiveChatModal.tsx`)
- **Visual Indicators**: Shows AI vs Human agent mode with badges
- **Customer Info Display**: Shows collected customer details in header
- **Enhanced UI**: Better message display with author identification
- **Status Indicators**: Clear visual feedback for chat status

### 4. Admin Dashboard (`src/components/admin/LiveChatDashboard.tsx`)
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live view of all chat sessions
- **Customer Details Panel**: Shows extracted customer information
- **Session Management**: Take, assign, and close chat sessions
- **Filtering & Search**: Filter by status, priority, and search functionality
- **Message Preview**: View recent messages from each session
- **AI/Human Indicators**: Clear distinction between AI-handled and human-handled chats

### 5. Enhanced Support Ticket Service (`src/lib/supportTicketService.ts`)
- **AI Message Support**: Handles messages from AI assistant
- **Flexible Author System**: Supports customer, agent, AI, and system messages
- **Metadata Storage**: Stores customer details and conversation summaries

## 🎯 Customer Detail Collection

The AI automatically collects and tracks:

| Field | Detection Method | Example Patterns |
|-------|------------------|------------------|
| **Name** | Natural language patterns | "My name is John", "I'm Sarah", "This is Mike" |
| **Email** | Regex extraction | any@domain.com format |
| **Phone** | Indian number patterns | +91-9876543210, 9876543210 |
| **Booking Reference** | Alphanumeric patterns | "booking ABC123", "reference PIC456" |
| **Issue Type** | Keyword analysis | "booking problem", "payment issue" |
| **Urgency** | Urgency keywords | "urgent", "emergency", "ASAP" |

## 🔄 AI Conversation Flow

```
1. Customer starts chat → AI greeting
2. AI asks for name → Extracts name from response
3. AI asks for email → Validates and stores email
4. Customer describes issue → AI categorizes and responds
5. AI provides relevant help → Continues conversation
6. If complex/urgent → Escalates to human agent
7. All data saved to admin dashboard
```
